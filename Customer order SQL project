Hi, in this file im using multiple tables and pulling queries off of several tables within this database to find the information needed




--1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.

SELECT customerid, firstname, lastname, country 
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE country <> 'USA';

--2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT customerid, firstname, lastname, country 
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE country = 'Brazil';

--3.Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT INV.invoiceid, CUST.firstname, CUST.lastname, INV.invoicedate, INV.billingcountry
FROM invoices INV
JOIN customers CUST
ON INV.Customerid=CUST.Customerid
WHERE Billingcountry = 'Brazil';

--4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT lastname, firstname, title
FROM employees
WHERE title LIKE '%sales%' 
AND TITLE like '%Agent%';

--5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT billingcountry
FROM invoices
ORDER BY billingcountry;

--6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT inv.invoiceid, emp.firstname, emp.lastname
FROM invoices inv
JOIN customers cust
ON inv.customerid=cust.customerid
JOIN employees emp
ON emp.employeeid=cust.supportrepid
WHERE title LIKE '%sales%' 
AND TITLE like '%Agent%';




--7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT inv.invoiceid, inv.total, cust.firstname, cust.lastname, inv.billingcountry, emp.firstname, emp.lastname
FROM invoices inv
JOIN customers cust
ON inv.customerid=cust.customerid
JOIN employees emp
ON emp.employeeid=cust.supportrepid
WHERE title LIKE '%sales%' 
AND TITLE like '%Agent%';


--8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_invoices
FROM invoices
WHERE invoicedate LIKE '%2009%';



--9. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(total) AS total_sales
FROM invoices 
WHERE invoicedate LIKE '%2009%';


--10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT tra.name, inv.invoicelineid
FROM tracks tra
JOIN invoice_items inv
ON tra.trackid = inv.trackid;



--11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.


SELECT tra.name AS TRACK, inv.invoicelineid, art.name as artist_name
FROM tracks tra
JOIN invoice_items inv
ON tra.trackid = inv.trackid
JOIN albums alb
ON alb.albumid = tra.albumid
JOIN artists art
ON art.artistid = alb.artistid;



--12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.



SELECT alb.title AS album_name, tra.name AS track_name, med.name AS media_type, gen.name AS genre_name
FROM tracks tra
JOIN media_types med
ON tra.mediatypeid = med.mediatypeid
JOIN genres gen
ON gen.genreid = tra.genreid
JOIN albums alb
ON alb.albumid = tra.albumid;



--13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.


SELECT emp.firstname, emp.lastname, ROUND(SUM(inv.total),2)  AS total_sales
FROM invoices inv
JOIN customers cust
ON inv.customerid=cust.customerid
JOIN employees emp
ON emp.employeeid=cust.supportrepid
WHERE title LIKE '%sales%' 
AND TITLE like '%Agent%'
GROUP BY  emp.firstname, emp.lastname;


--14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?


WITH CTE_chinook AS (SELECT emp.firstname, emp.lastname, SUM(inv.total) AS totalsum
FROM invoices inv
JOIN customers cust
ON inv.customerid=cust.customerid
JOIN employees emp
ON emp.employeeid=cust.supportrepid
WHERE title LIKE '%sales%' 
AND TITLE like '%Agent%'
AND invoicedate LIKE '%2009%'
GROUP BY emp.firstname, emp.lastname)

SELECT firstname, lastname, ROUND(MAX(totalsum), 2) AS Max_seller
 FROM cte_chinook;
