--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 


#1. How many orders were placed in January? 

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'orderID';


#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 

SELECT COUNT(*) Product 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product LIKE 'iphone'
AND length (orderID)= 6
AND orderID <> 'orderID';



#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 

SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'orderID';



#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 

SELECT Product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;


#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity )*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;


Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT Product, Quantity, SUM(Quantity * price) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';


#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
select

SELECT 
COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum), 
AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2
AND length (orderID)= 6
AND orderID <> 'orderID';
